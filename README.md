This collision avoidance algorithm includes collision detection algorithm, collision resolution and waypoint guidance algorithm.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
Matlab
```

For avoiding multiple dynamic obstacles:
$ CA_dynamic.m
Or
$ CA_dynamic_2.m


For avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles:
